🌍 Problem Statement

Government schemes, scholarships, and NGO donations suffer from:

Fund leakage & corruption

Ghost beneficiaries

Manual verification delays

Money mule fraud

Lack of transparency

Traditional systems rely on centralized databases that are opaque and vulnerable.

💡 Our Solution – ExcessScheme

ExcessScheme is a decentralized mediator platform that:

Converts welfare funds into blockchain tokens

Distributes them via smart contracts

Tracks every transaction transparently

Detects money mule fraud using AI/ML

Built entirely on Algorand Blockchain using AlgoKit smart contracts.

🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system operates in two major layers:

🏛️ 1️⃣ Fund Provider Layer

(Government / NGO / Private Organizations)

Step 1 – Fund Deposit

Organizations deposit funds into the platform wallet.

Step 2 – Tokenization

Funds are converted into Algorand Standard Assets (ASA) tokens.

Each scheme gets its own token:

ScholarshipToken

DonationToken

ReliefToken

Step 3 – Smart Contract Logic (AlgoKit)

Smart contracts define:

Eligibility rules

Distribution conditions

Vesting timelines

Redemption controls

Everything is automated and tamper-proof.

🔹 Scholarship Tokenization API (Innovation Block)

We introduce a dedicated module for:

Dynamic token creation for new schemes

Automated smart contract deployment

Liquidity control mechanisms

Controlled redemption

This enables programmable welfare infrastructure.

👩‍🎓 2️⃣ Beneficiary Layer

(Schools / Students / Public Users)

Identity Verification

Users register and verify using:

Aadhaar

PAN

After KYC (Know Your Customer), identity metadata is securely mapped to blockchain.

Token Distribution

Once verified:

Tokens are transferred to user wallets

Every transaction is recorded on Algorand

Full transparency is maintained

No manual interference.

🔍 Money Mule Detection (Advanced Innovation)

Fraudsters often collect funds from multiple beneficiaries.

Since Algorand provides a transparent ledger, we:

Analyze transaction graphs

Detect fund clustering

Identify repeated redirections

Flag suspicious wallets

AI/ML Engine

Our system:

Builds transaction networks

Detects anomaly patterns

Identifies potential mule accounts

If abnormal aggregation is detected:

Tokens can be flagged

Wallets can be restricted

Alerts are triggered

This makes the system fraud-resistant.
